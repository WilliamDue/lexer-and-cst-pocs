\section{Introduction}
Introduction.

\section{Theory}
Hills paper ``Parallel lexical analysis and parsing on the AMT
distributed array processor'' \cite{HILL1992699} describes a method to obtain the path in a deterministic finite automata given a input string. This section will describe the theory of this method and extend the it for tokenization.

% I should probably mention that pareas also uses this paper and does tokenization but I have no idea how they do it.
\subsection{Data-parallel Lexical Analysis}
To explain the theory of parallel lexical analysis we first remind the reader of the definition of a deterministic finite automaton.
\begin{definition}[DFA]
  A deterministic finite automata \cite{10.5555/1196416} \cite{enwiki:1192025610} is given by a 5-tuple $(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ where.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $Q$ is the set of states where $|Q| < \infty$.
    \item $\Sigma$ is the set of symbols where $|\Sigma| < \infty$.
    \item $\delta: \Sigma \times Q \to Q$ is the transition function.
    \item $q_0 \in Q$ is the initial state.
    \item $F\subseteq Q$ is the set of accepting states.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
\noindent This definition is fine as is but we will need to reformualte it to develop data-parallel lexical analysis. We would want the definition to use a curried transition function. But for this to hold then the DFA would also have to be total.
\begin{definition}[Total DFA]
  A DFA $(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ is said to be total if and only if
  \begin{align*}
    \delta(a, q) \in Q : \forall (a, q) \in \Sigma \times Q
  \end{align*}
  If a DFA is total we may use a curried transition function $\delta: \Sigma \to Q \to Q$.
\end{definition}
\noindent This is needed since else the the function would not be fully defined in the domains $\Sigma$ and $Q$.

The reason for doing so is because if we have any two functions $g = \delta(a)$ and $f = \delta(a')$ then it follows from composition that.
\begin{align*}
  g(f(q)) = (g \circ f) (q)
\end{align*}
This allows for an alternative way of determining if a string can be produced by an DFA. Instead of first evaluating $f(q)$, then $g(f(q))$ and then checking if this state is a member of $F$. We could instead partially apply $\delta$ to the symbols and then compose them to a single function which could be used to determine if a string is valid. This sets the stage for data-parallel lexing, we want to find a way to make the problem into a \texttt{map-reduce}. We want to do this because it can be computed using a data-parallel implementation unlike the normal way of traversing a DFA.



\noindent For the ability to use a data-parallel \texttt{map-reduce} we must have a monoidal structure. Here $\Delta$ is the set of all the composed partially applied $\delta$ functions needs to be closed under function composition.

\begin{proposition}[DFA Composition Closure]
  Given a total DFA, the set of all partially applied function compositions (Endofunctions) that is closed under function composition $\Delta: \{Q \to Q\}$. Is the set $\Delta = \Delta_i$ in the recurrence relation with the smallest $i$ such that $\Delta_i = \Delta_{i + 1}$.
  \begin{align*}
    \Delta_1 &= \{\delta(a) : a \in \Sigma \} \\
    \Delta_{i + 1} &= \Delta_i \cup \{f \circ g : f, g \in \Delta_i\}
  \end{align*}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  We will start by showing that a solution $\Delta$ exists. First note that the cardinality is monotonically increasing i.e. $\Delta_i \subseteq \Delta_{i + 1}$ since $\Delta_{i + 1}$ is a union of $\Delta_i$ and another set. Secondly note that since $|Q| < \infty$ then a finite amount of functions of the form $Q \to Q$ can be created. Since the set is bounded and increasing then at some point $\Delta_i = \Delta_{i + 1}$ and the smallest $i$ where it holds is the solution $\Delta$.

  For $\Delta$ to be closed under function composition, then for arbitray $f, g \in \Delta$ it must hold that $f \circ g \in \Delta$. Since $\Delta_1$ is the set of endofunctions that contructs $\Delta$ then all elements of $\Delta$ can be expressed on the form.
  \begin{align*}
    \delta(a_1) \circ \dots \circ \delta(a_n) \in \Delta
  \end{align*}
  If all combinations of $\Delta_1$ of any sequence length are members of $\Delta$ then $\Delta$ would be closed under function composition. Futhermore, it is known that $\Delta$ is finite so combinations after some $\Delta_i = \Delta_{i + 1}$ would only add new sequences of compositions but no new endofunctions. Therefore it suffices to show that if all combinations of length $k$ where $1 \leq k \leq i$ is a subset of $\Delta_i$ then $\Delta$ is closed under function composition. This can be shown using a proof by induction.

  Base: $\Delta_1$ trivially holds since it only contains sequences of length one and they are the initial endofunctions.

  Step: Given $\Delta_i$ contains every combination of length $i$ or less then we to show this implies that $\Delta_{i + 1}$ will contain every combination of length $i + 1$ or less.


  By definition $\Delta_{i + 1}$ it must contain every of length $i$ or less due to $\Delta_i \leq \Delta_{i + 1}$. It remains to show that every sequence of length $i + 1$ is a member of $\Delta_{i + 1}$. We know $\Delta_i$ will contain every sequence of length $1$ and $i$ by monotonicity. It is also known that a direct product of $\Delta_i$ is used in the definition meaning $\{f \circ g : f, g \in \Delta_i\} \subseteq \Delta_{i + 1}$. There by a direct product between sequences of length $1$ and $i$ leading to every sequence of length $i + 1$ being a member of $\Delta_{i + 1}$. Thereby $\Delta$ is closed under function composition.
\end{proof}
\noindent Since $\Delta$ is closed under function composition then it follows that $\Delta$ can induce a monoidal structure.

\begin{corollary}[Total DFA monoid]
  DFA composition closure induces a semigroup which intern induces the monoid $(\Delta \cup \{id\}, \circ)$ where $id: Q \to Q$ and $id(q) = q$.
\end{corollary}
\noindent Knowing this we can establish the following algorithm
\begin{algorithm}[Data-parallel Lexical Analysis]
  It can be determined in $O(n)$ work and $O(\log n)$ span if a string can be produced by a DFA. First construct the total DFA $(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ from the DFA.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Partially apply $\delta$ to every symbol in the input string such that it becomes a sequence of endofunctions.
    \item Reduce the endofunction in to a single endofunction $\delta': Q \to Q$.
    \item Evaluate $\delta'(q_0)$ and determine if $\delta'(q_0) \in F$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{algorithm}
