abstract = {I discuss an implementation of a parallel lexical analyser and parser for the AMT Distributed Array Processor (DAP). I show that by utilising the two dimensional topology of the DAP it is possible to improve the complexity of the Hillis & Steele [5,6] lexing algorithm from logarithmic squared time to logarithmic time in relation to the input length. I also show that the conclusions produced by Barnard & Skillicorn [1] that languages generated by LL(1) grammars can be parsed in logarithmic time on SIMD system is incorrect, and only a subset of the languages generated can be parsed in at least logarithmic time.}

  abstract = {A deterministic parallel LL parsing algorithm is presented. The algorithm is based on a transformation from a parsing problem to parallel reduction. First, a nondeterministic version of a parallel LL parser is introduced. Then, it is transformed into the deterministic version---the LLP parser. The deterministic LLP(q,k) parser uses two kinds of information to select the next operation --- a lookahead string of length up to k symbols and a lookback string of length up to q symbols. Deterministic parsing is available for LLP grammars, a subclass of LL grammars. Since the presented deterministic and nondeterministic parallel parsers are both based on parallel reduction, they are suitable for most parallel architectures.},
